# GetPrimesExercise
Run the program and pass in the product you want to extract the primes from.
It will output the primes on the comamnd window less than one second.

A question:
The sencond example you provide "113445566777" seems to be valid, it is in ascending order ,and I can get the primes from it.


Currently, I am using a recrusive function to get the pirmes, I set restriction for it to run only 4 round to optimaze performance
And in the future, it can be improved to cater for any length of products, pick 5 from 15 digits and so on.

And also, more validation could be applied as well. 

And we can add some unit testing for this project, like using some random number generator to test more numbers.
